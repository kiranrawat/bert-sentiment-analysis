Sentiment Analysis with Bert

In this guided project, I have analyzed a dataset for sentiment analysis. I have also worked on how to read in a PyTorch BERT model and adjust the architecture for multi-class classification. Furthermore, I have changed optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance. In fine-tuning this model, I have designed a train and evaluate loop to monitor model performance as it trains, including saving and loading models. Finally, I have built a Sentiment Analysis model that leverages BERT's large-scale language knowledge.
